# Web of Science example code

## Data
- Data come from the University of Michigan's copy of the [Web of Science](https://www.webofknowledge.com/). Rather than using the API, our library has purchased access to a dump of the data.

## Tools
- The notebooks in this directory heavily rely on PySpark for data processing. You'll need a cluster with the appropriate software to run this code.

## Purpose
- Mainly, I am working with the WoS as part of my dissertation. 
- Everyone at UofM and some others around the world have access to this data set, however, so I am providing some of my code in case others find it helpful. 

## Organization
- In this directory, there are notebooks for cleaning and preprocessing WoS data into a more useable format. In the subfolders, there is code for specific projects/tasks/questions.

## Updates
- More code will be available periodically as I clean it up and document it. 
- If you find errors, please let me know. 
- If you would like an example to be added, ask me. If I have already witten similar code, I am happy to add it here. I do not have the time to write new or custom code for others, however. 

## UM users
- If you are affiliated with the University of Michigan, you have access to all the same tools and data that I am using.
- Reach out to the library to get access wo thr WoS data
- Reach out to hpc-support@umich.edu to get set up using the cavium thunderx hadoop cluster (where I run pyspark and generated these examples).
